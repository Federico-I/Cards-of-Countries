# Cards-of-Countries

I typed this small application along the JavaScript course i took on Udemy. The languages that were implemented are JavaScript, CSS and HTML.

The main goal of the project is to study the functionality of an application and the architecture of the code using the functions Asynchronous/Await in Vanilla JavaScript.
