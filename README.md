# Cards-of-Countries

I typed this small application along with the JavaScript course I took on Udemy. The languages that were used are JavaScript, CSS and HTML.

The main goal of the project is to study the functions Asynchronous/Await in Vanilla JavaScript, how this functions deteremine the architecture of the code and the performance of the application at the moment of fetching the data from an API.
